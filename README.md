# UFO Sighting Report Application

UFO Sighting Report Application is the go-to place for reporting your wildest, most outrageous sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects or other extraterrestrial encounters. It's fast, trustworthy, and safe – we promise we won't abduct your data!

## Features

- Report your UFO sighting in just a few steps – we won't probe you for more information than necessary!
- Add images (if you're lucky enough to have some) – but please, no Photoshop hoaxes!
- View other reports of strange sightings provided by the community – because sometimes, the truth is out there.

This app has been abducted by many extraterrestrial enthusiasts who just can't get enough of reporting their strange sightings. But don't just take our word for it - here are some rave reviews from our fellow believers in the unknown:

> I used to feel like I was the only one seeing strange things in the sky, but with this app, I now know that the truth is out there! It's great to finally have a community of like-minded individuals who share my passion for extraterrestrial encounters.".
> **Chad Gipt**, avid stargazer and amateur ufologist.

> "If you're tired of being ridiculed by your friends and family for your crazy UFO stories, then this app is for you! With just a few taps, you can submit your sightings to a group of people who won't judge you for believing in little green men. Plus, it's a great way to prove to your skeptics that you're not crazy... or maybe you are, but at least you're not alone!".
> **Elon Saucer**, founder of SaucerX and believer in all things extraterrestrial.

## Installation

To install the application, you will need to have PHP and a web server installed on your system. Once you have PHP installed, simply clone this repository to your local machine and place it in your web server's root directory.

## Tools Used

We used some seriously out-of-this-world tech to create this UFO Sighting Report Application:

- PHP: a server-side scripting language that helped us communicate with our alien overlords and store your reports in a secure database.
- HTML: a markup language that allowed us to design a sleek interface that even the most advanced extraterrestrial species would envy.
- MySQL: a relational database management system that helped us keep track of all the weird and wonderful sightings that have been reported.
- Bootstrap: a popular CSS framework that made sure the app looked good on any device, whether it's a smartphone or a flying saucer.

And of course, UFO Sighting Report Application itself is open source with a **[public repository](https://github.com/mdenitti/ufo)** on GitHub – we're not hiding anything from you!
